          relief to us at support@holaplex.com. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
          established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims,
          counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and
          interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration
          Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/;

          mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be

          arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
          findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any
          damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
          basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
          binding upon you and us.

          relief to us at support@holaplex.com. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
          established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims,

          will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford
          to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver
          from JAMS, Holaplex will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s

          relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
          frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
          submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed
          location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
          of competent jurisdiction.
